        <title>What Makes a Linux Admin</title>
        <author>Jeremy Tavan</author>
        <description><![CDATA[
		   <p>I’m sorry if the title of this post sounds like I’m going to get all philosophical and start discussing the skills and personal characteristics that make someone a true Linux administrator. That’s not what this is about. Instead, it’s a lot more prosaic. If you’re using endpoint management software to track servers, and you want to audit the list of accounts with administrative privileges on a system, how do you do it?</p>

<p>In both Windows and MacOS, the definition of an “administrator” account is fairly easy. Under Windows, you look at the Administrators group. On MacOS there are a few ways to enumerate admins, but it all boils down to the users who have the “Allow user to administer this computer” checkbox checked.<label for="sn-dpjug8rs3vjz" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-dpjug8rs3vjz" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Of course, as Unix systems, Macs also are subject to many of the criteria in the definition below. </span> Under Linux, things aren’t so straightforward. How would one define a Linux admin account for purposes of inventory and monitoring? I started thinking about this recently and came up with the following definition, which is definitely a work in progress:</p>

<p>An administrator of a Linux server is any user that meets any of the following definitions:<label for="sn-yb8mexmn7sc7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-yb8mexmn7sc7" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">I know the oldschool UNIX admins are going to yell at me for the group names in (2). Sorry.</span></p>

<ol>
  <li>Is UID 0</li>
  <li>Is a member of the group <code>wheel</code> or <code>admin</code> or <code>administrators</code> or <code>root</code> 3. Exists in the sudoers file with an ALL permission line</li>
  <li>Exists in a group that exists in the sudoers file with an ALL permission line</li>
  <li>Exists in the <code>.k5login</code> file of any user account meeting any of criteria 1-4</li>
</ol>

<p>There are certainly other criteria which would be functionally equivalent to the above (for example, any user that can edit the sudoers file), but this seems like a good place to start for machines that are set up somewhat normally and not already compromised. I have BigFix relevance code for 1-4 on the list, which is complicated enough, and support for inspecting <code>/root/.k5login</code>, but haven’t yet implemented the full (5) successfully.</p>

        <title>Building a Home Enterprise Network Part 1</title>
        <author>Jeremy Tavan</author>
        <description><![CDATA[
		   <p>I decided, during my recent SANS overview course’s day on defensive network infrastructure, that I really don’t know enough about networking. Sure, I had all the basics - I understood the basics of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model">OSI model</a>, setting up computers to talk to each other over TCP/IP, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing">CIDR</a> notation, how to crimp a functional RJ45 patch cable, &amp;c. but I really had never had to learn about how enterprise networks go together. My employer has a large department to take care of that - I just have to use the thing. But I’m not comfortable just using the thing. So I decided to teach myself networking and network security by building the most complicated home network in California.<label for="sn-kahdulu7bw3f" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-kahdulu7bw3f" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">This may be an exaggeration, but probably not by a whole lot.</span></p>

<p>I’m not going to put a complete network diagram in this blog posting,<label for="sn-7yd5ks9kk0t3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-7yd5ks9kk0t3" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">If you’re interested in the details, get in contact with me and I’d be happy to discuss it. </span> but let’s go over some of the most interesting features of what I’ve done so far and what’s planned.</p>

<h3 id="virtualization-server">Virtualization Server</h3>
<p>One of the first things I bought was a virtualization server, because I knew that I wanted to pull most of the services running on my network off of the desktop computers currently running them and place them on a power-efficient, modern virtualization system. I’m running ProxMox 4 as the base management system, and have a number of KVM virtual machines and LXC containers in place and planned. Unfortunately, I’m currently experiencing severe performance issues between the LXC containers and the outside network via the virtio network drivers and an Open vSwitch bridge on the host.<label for="sn-yj96tehllpnh" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-yj96tehllpnh" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Does anyone know what causes these &lt;1kB/s throughputs? Please contact me!</span></p>

<p>The server itself is a mini-ITX motherboard with one of the new Intel Xeon 1540D chips on board. 8 cores, 16 threads, and 45W TDP. Talks to &gt;64GB of DDR4, has piles of SATA ports and five network ports (two 1Gig, two 10Gig copper, one IPMI). Slapped that plus a couple ZFS mirrored 1TB SSDs in a cute little 2U rackmount box from <a href="http://www.plinkusa.com/">PLinkUSA</a> and I have most all the compute I need for services on the network.</p>

<h3 id="managed-switch">Managed Switch</h3>
<p>Netgear sell a 24-port managed gigabit switch with two copper and two SFP+ 10GigE ports for $500. Wat. I’m pretty impressed with the thing so far - enough so that I plan on buying a second one for my media room and connecting the two via fiber for a single integrated management interface. Plus, I have configured one of the copper 10Gig ports as a mirror port for monitoring and the other serves as my virtualization box’s trunk port. Channel bonding? Sure - it does that. I have my NAS plugged in via four channel-bonded 1Gig ports. That took all of about 2 minutes to set up.</p>

<h3 id="virtual-machine-router">Virtual Machine Router</h3>
<p>My router is a KVM virtual machine running <a href="http://www.pfsense.org/">pfSense</a>. I’d never played with pfSense before, but I’m really impressed. It’s like you took all those web GUIs from home routers and configured them for every feature you could possibly ever want and removed all the extraneous graphical crap. It even has a package management system for adding more features - installing NUT for talking to my UPS’s SNMP interface was about a 5 minute job. The only real issue I have with pfSense is that the firewall rules are basically backwards from what I’m used to. You configure rules based on the network that is ORIGINATING the traffic, not based on what’s allowed to enter the destination network. So much confusion at first, but in their defense they DO document that somewhat.</p>

<h3 id="vlans">VLANs</h3>
<p>Oh yes, we do VLANs in this household. Currently running separate VLANs for storage, PCs, printers, IoT devices, media devices, infrastructure management interfaces, external-facing services, security cameras … It’s a pain to have to buy and configure a bunch of smart-ish switches<label for="sn-5i72y9nnpzx8" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-5i72y9nnpzx8" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Do not buy the Netgear GS108PEv3 (or earlier versions of the same thing). It’s a garbage pocket switch that claims to support proper 802.1q but doesn’t fully. You can’t (as far as I’ve been able to determine) set it up for a management VLAN.</span> but I like the segmentation and the control that this gives me with firewalls over what talks to what. It should also make detection of bad easier.</p>

<h3 id="commercial-style-waps">Commercial-style WAPs</h3>
<p>One of the secondary motivations for this project was that I was tired of consumer routers that have to be replaced annually or malfunction just enough to annoy but not enough to trigger replacement (like my old Asus router that needed weekly reboots to get the wireless working again). Once I implemented VLAN tagging, though, I realized that I really needed a more capable wireless access point that could handle it. I picked up an Engenius smoke-detector-style WAP with all the appropriate features, and while I’m not pleased with the performance of its management interface, it does appear to do the job, at least on the 2.4GHz band.  It does allow me to have multple SSIDs, each with its own authentication and VLAN tags. One issue encountered and overcome is that the WAP had a “rapid handoff” mode that caused it to drop connections below a certain signal strength threshold in order to encourage devices to connect to a closer WAP. That doesn’t work well if you only have the one WAP! To do: implement proper 802.1X RADIUS authentication.</p>

<h3 id="network-monitoring">Network Monitoring</h3>
<p>I’ve got a VM running a wide range of network monitoring tools, though at the moment they’re all just barely at the “spun up” state, and I haven’t yet configured all the alerting/active response stuff that I want. Bro for packet/protocol inspection, Snort monitoring, &amp;c.<label for="sn-ebu91t0py5gb" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-ebu91t0py5gb" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">$30/year for the Snort VRT rule updates for home users? Stupid cheap. </span></p>

        <title>SANS SEC501 Reflections</title>
        <author>Jeremy Tavan</author>
        <description><![CDATA[
		   <p>I just returned from <a href="http://sans.org/">SANS</a> <a href="http://sans.org/sec501/">SEC501</a>, my first formal Information Security training class in about fifteen years, held at their Network Security 2015 event in Las Vegas. This is a broad but “Advanced” overview class aimed at getting people a familiarity with as many topics as possible in the time available. I was pleased with the course with a few reservations, and I’m really glad I didn’t take one of the lower-level overview courses (<a href="http://sans.org/sec301/">SEC301</a> or <a href="http://sans.org/sec401">SEC401</a>) because this one was perfectly fine for someone at my level of background and experience. It could have been more challenging and technical and that would have been even better. A few notes on my experience:</p>

<h3 id="a-week-is-a-very-long-time-to-study-a-subject-full-time">A week is a very long time to study a subject full time.</h3>
<p>This isn’t just a complaint about being away from home and family for a week at a stretch. That’s manageable. The amount of time spent learning at these courses, however, is problematic. It wasn’t unusual for me to spend from 0830 to 2130 in the convention center, between the course itself and the evening lectures and tournament. After a week of this I was really ready for some natural light and fresh air. I know there’s a lot of material to cover, but it’s hard to keep sharp for that many hours at a time even with breaks.</p>

<h3 id="a-week-is-a-very-short-time-for-a-meaningful-class">A week is a very short time for a meaningful class.</h3>
<p>There’s a huge amount of material to cover in an overview class, and a week just plain isn’t long enough to do it justice. So many topics were breezed through with just top-level bullet points. So many of the labs would have been more useful if we had to really dig in to them and do some analysis rather than just copying and pasting into a terminal. Our instructor definitely enriched the course with humorous and enlightening anecdotes and suggestions,<label for="sn-2dgs31nyf1iz" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-2dgs31nyf1iz" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Of course, the discussions of virtualization and testing labs are going to result in some rather expensive purchases. C’est la vie. </span> but had he just gone off the slides I would have felt cheated by the cursory treatment of the subject areas.</p>

<h3 id="netwars-is-a-ton-of-fun">NetWars is a ton of fun.</h3>
<p>In addition to SEC501, I also signed up for <a href="https://www.sans.org/netwars/dfir-tournament">NetWars DFIR</a> because hey, why not, it’s free with the longform training course. This turned out to be the most entertaining and educational part of the entire trip. I hadn’t touched a computer forensics tool in my life before the day of the tournament, but due to convenient timing of the SEC501 topics, we did a quick overview of forensics tools the day the tournament started. Picture my surprise when I found myself on the leaderboard (10th place) after the first day. On the second day people jumped ahead super quickly,<label for="sn-ggep2w4soeu0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-ggep2w4soeu0" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">I won’t accuse them of working on the questions during the day, but it was pretty suspicious </span> but I still managed to come in 14th out of about 75 participants. I had no idea that digging information out of hard disk, memory, server logs, and network pcap data would be so much fun. This will be a career-influencing experience.</p>

<p>That’s it for my quick reflections. I may well have additional posts to write on the various topics discussed during the class. I would like to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/phenrycissp">Paul Henry</a> for leading a fun and educational intro to InfoSec. I look forward to future, more specialized and detailed classes.</p>

        <title>Identifying PCI devices in Powershell</title>
        <author>Jeremy Tavan</author>
        <description><![CDATA[
		   <p>I had a need recently to identify the device that failed on a Dell server. The server reported the failure in terms of PCI Bus, Device, and Function. Unfortunately, unlike Linux with its <code>lspci(8)</code>, Windows doesn’t expose those very easily. The Dell technician suggested installing and running their diagnostic gathering tool on the server, but given protections in place on the server it would have taken some time to do so.<label for="sn-16m95zjbn4ed" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-16m95zjbn4ed" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">It should be noted that finding the code to obtain this information took at least as long as whitelisting the tool and running it would have, but was much more educational. </span> A little searching on the Internet and a little assembly of code resulted in the following:</p>

        <title>Earplugs. Yes.</title>
        <author>Jeremy Tavan</author>
        <description><![CDATA[
		   <p>Earplugs. Own them and use them. You never know when you’re going to be working on a server in a datacenter that has an unkillable, unbearably loud thermal alarm going off at the time. It’s hard to work with your hands when they’re in your ears. Even when there’s no alarm, datacenters are loud and unpleasant. Reduce that unpleasantness with earplugs.</p>

        <title>Creating a custom liquid tag for Jekyll</title>
        <author>Jeremy Tavan</author>
        <description><![CDATA[
		   <p>In <a href="/2015/08/16/Things%20I%20need%20to%20Create.html">Things I Need To Create For This Blog</a> I mentioned that I needed an easier way to create sidenotes than pasting in a bunch of ugly HTML in my Markdown. So, following the super simple template on the Jekyll page and not knowing any Ruby, I created a Sidenote liquid tag.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><a name="True-1"></a><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">&#39;securerandom&#39;</span>

<a name="True-16"></a>  <span class="k">end</span>
<a name="True-17"></a><span class="k">end</span>
<a name="True-18"></a>
<a name="True-19"></a><span class="no">Liquid</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Template</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">register_tag</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;sidenote&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">Jekyll</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">SidenoteTag</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now all I need to do to create a sidenote is to put in a liquid tag:</p>
<pre>{.% sidenote And sidenote text goes here %}</pre>
<p>and it gets converted into a proper sidenote.<label for="sn-20o597tthu54" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-20o597tthu54" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Just like this. </span></p>

        <title>Things I Need To Create For This Blog</title>
        <author>Jeremy Tavan</author>
        <description><![CDATA[
		   <p>I’m having a good time figuring out how to build a static page blog using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, but there are a few pieces missing for it to really do what I need.</p>

<p>First, I’m trying to use <a href="http://www.daveliepmann.com/tufte-css/">Tufte.css</a> for the look and feel of the pages because I haven’t seen anything more readable or pleasing to the eyes. Unfortunately, certain features like sidenotes and marginnotes require some funky inline HTML to work, and I haven’t figure out how to embed them automatically in the Markdown or Textile post data sources.<label for="sn-b38hn98cx8qp" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-b38hn98cx8qp" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">That said, I can just embed the raw HTML in Markdown content if I’m OK with all that structure mixed in to my content. </span></p>

<p>So it looks like I’m going to need to build a custom filter to allow me to use simple directives and have them convert into appropriate sidenote and marginnote HTML. <strong>Update</strong>: Done. See <a href="/2015/08/20/Custom%20Jekyll%20liquid%20tag.html">this post</a> for details.</p>

<p>Second, given how much of the work I do is in BigFix Relevance Language and BigFix Action Script, I’m going to have to extend the <a href="http://pygments.org/">pygments</a> syntax highlighter with a custom language lexer for those. And then there will be the fun of designing a syntax highlighting stylesheet that doesn’t pollute my pages with a rainbow of fruity highlighting modes.</p>

<p>Both of these things are fairly new to me, so I’m looking forward to figuring out how to do it.</p>

        <title>Detecting Windows 10</title>
        <author>Jeremy Tavan</author>
        <description><![CDATA[
		   <p>Let’s say you’ve got an endpoint management solution in place that doesn’t yet understand Windows 10 and instead reports it as various flavors of Windows 8 or 8.1. How do you detect what flavor of Windows really is running on the system?</p>

<pre><code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProductName
</code></pre>

<p>Nothing Earth-shattering about this one, but it was a simple solution to the problem. In BigFix Relevance, we can use the following (though it will be unnecessary once we’re running the version that has native detection for Windows 10):</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-scheme" data-lang="scheme"><a name="True-1"></a><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">exists</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">if </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">x64</span> <span class="nv">of</span> <span class="nv">operating</span> <span class="nv">system</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="nv">then</span> 
<a name="True-2"></a>            <span class="nv">unique</span> <span class="nv">values</span> <span class="nv">of</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">it</span> <span class="nv">as</span> <span class="nv">string</span> <span class="nv">as</span> <span class="nv">trimmed</span> <span class="nv">string</span><span class="p">)</span> 
<a name="True-3"></a>                <span class="nv">of</span> <span class="nv">values</span> <span class="s">&quot;ProductName&quot;</span> 
<a name="True-4"></a>                    <span class="nv">of</span> <span class="nv">keys</span> <span class="s">&quot;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion&quot;</span> 
<a name="True-5"></a>                        <span class="nv">of</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">x32</span> <span class="nv">registries</span><span class="c1">;x64 registries) </span>
<a name="True-6"></a>        <span class="k">else </span><span class="nv">unique</span> <span class="nv">values</span> <span class="nv">of</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">it</span> <span class="nv">as</span> <span class="nv">string</span> <span class="nv">as</span> <span class="nv">trimmed</span> <span class="nv">string</span><span class="p">)</span> 
<a name="True-7"></a>            <span class="nv">of</span> <span class="nv">values</span> <span class="s">&quot;ProductName&quot;</span> <span class="nv">of</span> <span class="nv">keys</span> <span class="s">&quot;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion&quot;</span> 
<a name="True-8"></a>                <span class="nv">of</span> <span class="nv">registry</span><span class="p">)</span> 
<a name="True-9"></a> <span class="nv">whose</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">it</span> <span class="nv">starts</span> <span class="nv">with</span> <span class="s">&quot;Windows 10&quot;</span><span class="p">))</span></code></pre></figure>

        <title>Here we go!</title>
        <author>Jeremy Tavan</author>
        <description><![CDATA[
		   So, I've read several discussions about how <!--excerpt.start-->I really should be recording things I do and things I learn in a journal to show as proof that I'm actually doing and learning things<!--excerpt.end-->. That sounded like good advice, and so I've put together this blog. I'm going to record my experiences doing security-related stuff at a large research university. I'll also document anything else I learn along the way, because learning is good, even if it's not directly security-related.
