			<p>So, I&#8217;ve read several discussions about how <!--excerpt.start-->I really should be recording things I do and things I learn in a journal to show as proof that I&#8217;m actually doing and learning things<!--excerpt.end-->. That sounded like good advice, and so I&#8217;ve put together this blog. I&#8217;m going to record my experiences doing security-related stuff at a large research university. It&#8217;s a really challenging environment, and I&#8217;m very glad that I spent seven years working all across the university in a client-oriented support role before pivoting to Information Security. Without the contacts and context, I&#8217;d be completely adrift.</p>
