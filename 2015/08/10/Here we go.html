		<p>So, I&#8217;ve read several discussions about how <!--excerpt.start-->I really should be recording things I do and things I learn in a journal to show as proof that I&#8217;m actually doing and learning things<!--excerpt.end-->. That sounded like good advice, and so I&#8217;ve put together this blog. I&#8217;m going to record my experiences doing security-related stuff at a large research university. I&#8217;ll also document anything else I learn along the way, because learning is good, even if it&#8217;s not directly security-related.</p>
